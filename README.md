# WP Graphql Advanced custom field post types

## What does this plugin do?

this plugin adds the option to expose post types made with ACF to the Graphql Schema from within the post type edit menu. It does this by adding the "show_in_graphql", "graphql_singular_name" and "graphql_plural_name" to the advanced configuration menu.
